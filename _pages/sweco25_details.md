geologic (“geol”) : "geotechnic" dataset ;  subsoil of Switzerland ; 30 classes
topographic (“topo”) : "alti3d" dataset ; topography of Switzerland ; 4 variables (elevation= digital elevation model, aspect= slope orientation, hillshade, and slope= steepness)
bioclimatic (“bioclim”)  : "chclim25" dataset ; past, current, and future climate of Switzerland ; individual precipitation and temperature over 1981-2017 period ; 30-y average climate normal (1981-2010) layers for 28 climate parameters (tave=temperature, prec=precipitation, etp=evapotranspiration, gdd0=growing day > 0) 
hydrologic (“hydro”)  : 1) "gwn07 " dataset (distance to the hydrological network) ; 2)"morph" (ecomorphology of the Swiss rivers and streams), and "swisstopo" (steepness of the watercourses ) datasets. 
edaphic (“edaph”) : 1) "eiv" dataset (local soil properties and climate conditions, 8 variables : soil pH, nutrients, moisture, moisture variability, aeration, humus, climate continentality, and light) ; 2) "modiffus" dataset (nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) loads)
land use and cover (“lulc”) : 1) "geostat25" dataset (land use and cover, 65 classes at 3 time periods) ; 2) "wslhabmap"	 (natural habitats, 41 categories (32 classes = second level and 9 groups= first level of the TypoCH classification)) 
population (“pop”) : "statpop" dataset, population density for 2010-2020
transportation (“trans”) : 1) "tlm3d" = distance to the road network ; 2) "sonbase" dataset describes the exposure to noise levels
vegetation (“vege”) : 1) "copernicus" dataset (dominant leaf : 2 categories coniferous and deciduous) ; 2) "nfi" (height of the vegetation canopy, maximum, minimum, and median values) 
remote sensing indices (“rs”) : "sdc" dataset (vegetation indices : (evi [2021] = enhanced vegetation index ; gci [2021] = green chlorophyll index ; lai [2021] = leaf area index ; ndvi [2017] = normalized difference vegetation index ; ndwi [2017] = normalized difference water index) at yearly time step for 1996-2021 period, when available.
